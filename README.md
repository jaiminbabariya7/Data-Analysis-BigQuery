## Getting Started
1. **Set Up BigQuery in GCP**:
   - Follow the instructions in `docs/setup.md` to create a new BigQuery project and navigate the BigQuery UI.

2. **Load Sample Data**:
   - Upload the provided JSON file containing sample data to a new dataset in BigQuery. See `docs/load_data.md`.

3. **Run Basic SQL Queries**:
   - Write and execute SQL queries to perform basic data analysis tasks. Refer to `sql/` directory for examples.

4. **Explore Table Management**:
   - Learn about modifying table schemas, partitioning, and clustering for optimizing query performance. Details in 'docs/table_management.md'.
